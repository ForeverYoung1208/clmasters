3. Writing test cases for Redux Form
We will write the test case for the below files which we have created earlier
User.test.tsx
Form.test.tsx
PersonDetailForm.test.tsx
AccountDetailForm.test.tsx
User.test.tsx
Inside test -> pages create a new folder named User and then create a new file named User.test.tsx

So what we have done above is:
We have imported the user component which we have created earlier.
We have used mount to check whether the component is defined or not.
We can use either use shallow or mount. If you want to view the top level of a component we can use shallow. But if you want to view in-depth then you can use mount. Have a look at the below video:
